/**	SUM_R1
	ROUND 1 - Add two numbers

	Use this small challenge to understand how the system works.



	For your convenience, a test framework has already been configured for this project.

	In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
	     sum(Integer, Integer) -> Integer

	Where:
	 - param[0] = a positive integer between 0-100
	 - param[1] = a positive integer between 0-100
	 - @return = an Integer representing the sum of the two numbers

	**/
	
    public int compute(int x, int y) 
    {
    	
    	/// this one returns an int not an Integer ..!!!
    	// I'm assuming you meant int not Integer ...
    	return x+y;
    }

}
